The Nautilus DevOps team has noticed performance issues in some Kubernetes-hosted applications due to resource constraints. To address this, they plan to set limits on resource utilization. Here are the details:


Create a pod named httpd-pod with a container named httpd-container. Use the httpd image with the latest tag (specify as httpd:latest). Configure the following container-level resource requests and limits for the container:

Requests: Memory: 15Mi, CPU: 100m

Limits: Memory: 20Mi, CPU: 100m

Note: The kubectl utility on the jump-host has been configured to work with the Kubernetes cluster.

Create the pod using the following manifest:
```
vi httpd-pod.yaml
```
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: httpd-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: httpd-container
    image: httpd:latest
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: "15Mi"
        cpu: "100m"
      limits:
        memory: "20Mi"
        cpu: "100m"
```
Save it and apply it:
```
kubectl apply -f httpd-pod.yaml
```
Verify the pod and resource settings:
```
kubectl get pod httpd-pod
kubectl describe pod httpd-pod
```
